        <p data-id="text-10-3" class="mb-4">If you’re reading this book, either as a student or a teacher, you’re
            going to be digging into the “practice” of science. Probably, someone, somewhere, has made you think
            about this before, and so you’ve probably already had a chance to imagine the possibilities. Who do you
            picture doing science? What do they look like? What are they doing?</p>
        <p data-id="text-10-4" class="mb-4">Often when we ask people to imagine this, they draw or describe people
            with lab coats, people with crazy hair, beakers and flasks of weird looking liquids that are bubbling
            and frothing. Maybe there’s even an explosion. Let’s be honest: Some scientists do look like this, or
            they look like other stereotypes: people readied with their pocket protectors and calculators, figuring
            out how to launch a rocket into orbit. Or maybe what comes to mind is a list of steps that you might
            have to check off for your science fair project to be judged; or, maybe a graph or data table with lots
            of numbers comes to mind.</p>
        <p data-id="text-10-5" class="mb-4">So let’s start over. When you imagine graphs and tables, lab coats and
            calculators, is that what you love? If this describes you, that’s great. But if it doesn’t, and that’s
            probably true for many of us, then go ahead and dump that image of science. It’s useless because it
            isn’t you. Instead, picture yourself as a maker and doer of science. The fact is, we need scientists and
            citizens like you, whoever you are, because we need all of the ideas, perspectives, and creative
            thinkers. This includes you.</p>
