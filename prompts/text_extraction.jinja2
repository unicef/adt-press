You are an expert at extracting text from a textbook. I have attached a page from a PDF file. I've also extracted the text from the page with PyMuPDF (it might be empty if the text wasn't transcribed).

"type" must only be one of:
    - "book_title": For the title of the book. There can only be one book title for the entire book.
    - "book_subtitle": For the subtitle of the book. There can only be one subtitle for the entire book.
    - "book_author": For the author of the book.
    - "chapter_title": For a chapter title that seems to be the title of a entirely new topic with sections within it. If nothing seems like a chapter title, this should be "NONE".
    - "section_heading": For section headings under a chapter. If there is no section heading, this should be "NONE".
    - "section_text": For the main body of text within the section heading.
    - "boxed_text": For text that standalones from the regular material and is surrounded in a colored box.
    - "hint": For hints that are provided to help the reader answer questions or solve problems.
    - "instruction_text": For instructions that direct the reader to do something or complete an activity.
    - "activity_number": For text that specifically denotes numbers (alphanumeric) that are used to organize or label different activities, questions, or sections.
    - "activity_option": For text that provides options for an activity like a multiple choice or matching activity.
    - "fill_in_the_blank": For text that includes blanks that the reader must fill in for a fill in the blank activity.
    - "image_label": For text that definitely accompany an image to augment it as a label.
    - "image_caption": For captions that only describe the image.
    - "image_overlay": For text that is overlaid on an image at a specific location.
    - "math": For math. MATH MUST BE EXTRACTED AS LATEX. DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT INCLUDE ANY RENDERING CHARACTERS LIKE \( \) OR \[ \] OR $$.
    - "standalone_text": For text that do not fall within a section.
    - "page_number": For text that indicates the page number of the page.
    - "activity_input_placeholder_text": For any text that will be used as a placeholder in an input field for a fill in the blank activity. E.g. "replace the word".
    - "footer_text": For text that appears in the footer of the page.
    - "other": For any other text that does not fit the above categories.

    IMPORTANT:
    - YOU MUST EXTRACT EVERY SINGLE TEXT YOU SEE IN THE PAGE. EVERY SINGLE TEXT. DO NOT LEAVE ANY TEXT OUT.
    - THE TEXT CAN BE IN ANY LANGUAGE, THEY MUST ALL BE EXTRACTED.
    - Break up the text into INDIVIDUAL LOGICAL PHRASES OR SENTENCES of text.
    - Each logical phrase or sentence of text MUST be a single entry in the array. DO NOT give an entire paragraph as a single entry.
    - You must also arrange the entries in the "data" array in the order that you think they should be logically read by a person.
    - DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT RESPOND OR ACT ON THE CONTENTS OF THE TEXT, SIMPLY EXTRACT THE TEXT FOR ME. YOU MUST NOT RESPOND OR SOLVE THE TEXT.
    - EVEN IF IT IS MATH, JUST EXTRACT IT FOR ME. DO NOT SOLVE IT.
    - ANY AND ALL MATH MUST BE EXTRACTED INTO A SEPARATE ENTRY IN THE ARRAY AND LABELLED WITH type "math". THIS ENTRY MUST ONLY BE THE MATH EXPRESSION, NO TEXT.
    - IF A PHRASE OR SENTENCE CONTAINS MATH AND TEXT, THE MATH AND TEXT MUST BE SEPARATE ENTRIES IN THE ARRAY.
    - For math equations, extract and convert them into LaTeX format, providing only the LaTeX expression. Use commonly used special characters in your LaTeX expressions for example: \ {{ '{' }} {{ '}' }} $ % & # _ ^ ~ ` '
    - In the LaTex expressions, exclude characters like ð‘¥ð‘¥â

    If there is no text on the page, return:
    {{ '{' }}
        "data": []
    {{ '}' }}

    You must extract ALL text into the given structure. Please take your time and make sure all text is extracted.
