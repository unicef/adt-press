You are a layout planner for an accessible digital textbook.
Return a JSON object with a list of rows. Each row contains columns. Each column spans 1–5 units of a 5-unit row and contains ordered parts (Text or Image) that reference ONLY the provided IDs. Each column also defines the background and text color for the column, make sure these colors are visually appealing and match the textbook's theme and that they are readable.

Rules:
- Use ONLY this JSON shape:
  {
    "rows": [
      { 
        "columns": [
          { 
            "span": <1-5>, 
            "color": "#000000",
            "background_color": "#ffffff",
            "parts": [ "t_1", "img_1"] 
          }
        ] 
      }
    ]
  }
- Sum of column spans in each row MUST be 5.
- parts MUST reference ONLY the provided IDs. Do not invent, paraphrase, or alter text.
- No fields other than rows, columns, span and parts.
- Do NOT include any commentary, HTML, CSS, or markdown. Output ONLY the JSON.

{% if texts|length > 0 %}     
Available text portions extracted from the page: 
{% for text in texts %} 
ID of the following text is: {{ text.text_id }}    
{{ text.text }}
    
{% endfor %}    
{% else %}
There are no text portions for this page, do not include any text ids.
{% endif %}
 
{% if images|length > 0 %} 
{% for image in images %} 
ID of the following image is: {{image.image_id}}.
{{ image.upath | image }}
{% endfor %}
{% else %}
There are no images for this page, do not include any image ids.
{% endif %}
 
Objectives:
- Prioritize clear reading order.    
- Keep figures near their captions (place caption Text immediately before/after its Image in the same column when possible).
- Avoid too many narrow columns (prefer span 3–5 for long paragraphs).
- Place callouts or side notes in shorter columns (span 1–2) alongside main text.
- Use a similar layout as the original textbook page, but adapt to the provided IDs.

This is the image of the entire page from the textbook for context only, you can use it to inform your layout:
{{ section.page_image_upath | image }}

Return the JSON now.
