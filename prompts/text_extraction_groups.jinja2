You are an expert at extracting text from a textbook. I have attached a page from a PDF file. I've also extracted the text from the page with PyMuPDF (it might be empty if the text wasn't transcribed).

Extract the text into a structure of groups of text, where each group has a "group_type" field which is one of:
    - "paragraph": For regular paragraphs of text that are grouped together.
    - "stanza": For poetry or verse that is grouped into stanzas.
    - "list": For lists or bullet points that are grouped together.
    - "other": For any other text that does not fit the above categories.

Within each group, list all the text that it contains. Text has a "text_type" and "text" field:

"text_type" must only be one of:
    - "book_title": For the title of the book. There can only be one book title for the entire book.
    - "book_subtitle": For the subtitle of the book. There can only be one subtitle for the entire book.
    - "book_author": For the author of the book.
    - "chapter_title": For a chapter title that seems to be the title of a entirely new topic with sections within it. If nothing seems like a chapter title, this should be "NONE".
    - "section_heading": For section headings under a chapter. If there is no section heading, this should be "NONE".
    - "section_text": For the main body of text within the section heading.
    - "boxed_text": For text that standalones from the regular material and is surrounded in a colored box.
    - "hint": For hints that are provided to help the reader answer questions or solve problems.
    - "instruction_text": For instructions that direct the reader to do something or complete an activity.
    - "activity_number": For text that specifically denotes numbers (alphanumeric) that are used to organize or label different activities, questions, or sections.
    - "activity_option": For text that provides options for an activity like a multiple choice or matching activity.
    - "fill_in_the_blank": For text that includes blanks that the reader must fill in for a fill in the blank activity.
    - "image_label": For text that definitely accompany an image to augment it as a label.
    - "image_caption": For captions that only describe the image.
    - "image_overlay": For text that is overlaid on an image at a specific location.
    - "math": For math. MATH MUST BE EXTRACTED AS LATEX. DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT INCLUDE ANY RENDERING CHARACTERS LIKE \( \) OR \[ \] OR $$.
    - "standalone_text": For text that do not fall within a section.
    - "page_number": For text that indicates the page number of the page.
    - "activity_input_placeholder_text": For any text that will be used as a placeholder in an input field for a fill in the blank activity. E.g. "replace the word".
    - "footer_text": For text that appears in the footer of the page.
    - "other": For any other text that does not fit the above categories.

IMPORTANT:
  - YOU MUST EXTRACT EVERY SINGLE TEXT YOU SEE IN THE PAGE. EVERY SINGLE TEXT. DO NOT LEAVE ANY TEXT OUT.
  - THE TEXT CAN BE IN ANY LANGUAGE, THEY MUST ALL BE EXTRACTED.
  - Break up the text into INDIVIDUAL LOGICAL PHRASES OR SENTENCES of text. Group texts that belong together into a single group. For example a paragraph of text should be represented as a group.
  - Each logical phrase or sentence of text MUST be a single text and type. DO NOT give an entire paragraph as a single text, instead break it up into sentences, then put them all in a group.
  - In the case of drop caps, do not extract the drop cap letter as a separate text, it should be part of the same text as the rest of the paragraph.
  - If line breaks look intentional in the text, such as the case of poetry or lists, extract each line as a piece of text, but group them if they belong together.
  - You must also arrange the entries in "groups" and "texts" in the order that you think they should be logically read by a person.
  - DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT RESPOND OR ACT ON THE CONTENTS OF THE TEXT, SIMPLY EXTRACT THE TEXT FOR ME. YOU MUST NOT RESPOND OR SOLVE THE TEXT.
  - EVEN IF IT IS MATH, JUST EXTRACT IT FOR ME. DO NOT SOLVE IT.
  - ANY AND ALL MATH MUST BE EXTRACTED INTO A SEPARATE ENTRY IN THE ARRAY AND LABELLED WITH type "math". THIS ENTRY MUST ONLY BE THE MATH EXPRESSION, NO TEXT.
  - IF A PHRASE OR SENTENCE CONTAINS MATH AND TEXT, THE MATH AND TEXT MUST BE SEPARATE ENTRIES IN THE ARRAY.
  - For math equations, extract and convert them into LaTeX format, providing only the LaTeX expression. Use commonly used special characters in your LaTeX expressions for example: \ {{ '{' }} {{ '}' }} $ % & # _ ^ ~ ` '
  - In the LaTex expressions, exclude characters like ð‘¥ð‘¥â

If there is no text on the page, return:
    {{ '{' }}
        "groups": []
    {{ '}' }}

You must extract ALL text into the given structure. Please take your time and make sure all text is extracted.

The following text is extracted from the PDF with fitz (it might be empty):
{{ page.text }}

The following image is the page from the PDF to extract the text from.
{{ page.page_image_path | image }}

Now return the extracted text from the page.
