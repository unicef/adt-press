I will provide you with a page from a textbook. Create a CONCISE description of the page for someone who is blind or visually impaired.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Keep the TOTAL description under 300 words (aim for 150-250 words)
- Be as brief as possible while conveying essential spatial and contextual information
- Focus ONLY on information that helps understand layout and positioning
- Do NOT describe text content in detail - screen readers will read the actual text
- Do NOT narrate entire conversations or long text blocks - just note their position and who is speaking

Your description should include:
1. Brief overview: Page layout style (e.g., "Two-page spread with cartoons and speech bubbles")
2. Spatial positioning: Where key elements are located (top-left, center, bottom-right, etc.)
3. Speech/text associations: WHO is speaking each speech bubble or what element text is attached to
4. Essential visual context: Only describe images/characters necessary to understand the layout
5. Text flow: How text elements relate spatially (e.g., "Caption below image points to volcano")

DO NOT:
- Describe every detail of illustrations
- Summarize the content of readable text
- List every small visual element
- Provide lengthy character descriptions
- Narrate the story or lesson content

Think: "Where is everything and who's talking?" NOT "What does everything say?"

I will provide you:
- The page image from the textbook
- Any extracted text sections from the page
- Any individual images from sections on the page

You will respond with two fields:
1. reasoning: Your internal planning about what to include/exclude to stay under 300 words
2. explanation: The CONCISE audio description (under 300 words) ready to be read aloud

IMPORTANT: The "explanation" field is the final description. Be direct and concise. Use spatial language efficiently.
