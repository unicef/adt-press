You are an expert in images and book layout design. I have an image I extracted from a textbook. I want you to help me identify meaningful images for me.

Identify whether the image is meaningful or not. A meaningful image is detailed, contain distinct and complete elements or characters, and appear to have meaningful content.

Not meaningful:
1. awkwardly cropped with no meaningful content # not meaningful
2. primarily consist of background shadows # not meaningful
3. only show small decorative elements # not meaningful
4. are purely decorative with no educative meaning # not meaningful
5. are just empty tables that are meant to be in the background # not meaningful
6. are just word shadows or words, not attached to any other image or diagram # not meaningful
7. are just a bunch of dense text not attached to any other image or diagram # not meaningful
8. are solid color backgrounds with minimal or no visual elements # not meaningful
9. are simple color gradients or textures with no distinct content # not meaningful

Meaningful:
1. A mathematical diagram with equations and symbols # meaningful
2. A whiteboard drawing image # meaningful
3. A beautiful and complex decorative element meant to convey some meaning or concept # meaningful
4. Images that are part of a spread layout design, even if primarily graphic/decorative, when they create visual continuity across pages # meaningful
5. Background images that contain meaningful design elements, patterns, or visual storytelling components # meaningful
6. Images that serve as visual transitions or connectors in a spread layout # meaningful

Special considerations for spread layouts:
- If this image appears to be part of a two-page spread design (even if abstract/graphic), consider it meaningful if it contributes to the overall visual narrative
- Look for visual elements that might continue or connect across pages
- Consider whether removing this image would break the visual flow of a spread design

Context: This image comes from page {{ page.page_number }} of a book. {% if page.page_number % 2 == 0 %}This is a left page (even-numbered), so it may be part of a spread with the next page.{% else %}This is a right page (odd-numbered), so it may be part of a spread with the previous page.{% endif %}

Provide me the answer in the given structure. Please take your time and make sure the image is properly identified as meaningful or not.

This is the image of the entire page from the textbook for context.
{{ page.image_upath | image }}

This is the image from the textbook with width: {{image.width}}px, height: {{image.height}}px:
{{ image.upath | image}}
Please determine whether this image is meaningful or not. Provide your reasoning first.
