You are an expert in images and book layout design. I have an image I extracted from a textbook. I want you to help me identify meaningful images for me.

Identify whether the image is meaningful or not. This filter should be VERY PERMISSIVE - we want to capture all sorts of figurative, decorative, and visual elements that contribute to the book's design and storytelling.

VERY LIMITED cases that are NOT meaningful (be extremely restrictive here):
1. completely blank/empty areas with no visual content whatsoever # not meaningful
2. pure solid color backgrounds with absolutely no design elements, patterns, or visual interest # not meaningful
3. heavily corrupted or completely illegible image data # not meaningful

MEANINGFUL (be very inclusive - when in doubt, classify as meaningful):
1. Any mathematical diagrams, equations, or symbols # meaningful
2. Any drawings, sketches, or artistic elements # meaningful
3. ALL decorative elements, patterns, borders, frames, or design flourishes # meaningful
4. Any lines, curves, geometric shapes, or abstract designs # meaningful
5. Background textures, gradients with visual interest, or atmospheric effects # meaningful
6. Any figurative images including illustrations, characters, objects, or scenes # meaningful
7. Visual elements that are part of spread layout design, even if abstract or minimal # meaningful
8. Design elements that create visual continuity, transitions, or flow # meaningful
9. Ornamental or stylistic elements that contribute to the book's aesthetic # meaningful
10. Any visual storytelling components, including abstract or symbolic imagery # meaningful
11. Typography treatments, stylized text, or text integrated with visual design # meaningful
12. Photographic elements, even if partially cropped or serving as background # meaningful
13. Architectural or structural design elements within the page layout # meaningful
14. Color blocks or shapes that serve a design purpose # meaningful
15. Any element that would be missed if removed from the visual composition # meaningful

Key principle: Default to MEANINGFUL. Only exclude if the image is completely empty, corrupted, or provides zero visual value.

Special considerations for spread layouts:
- If this image appears to be part of a two-page spread design, it should almost always be considered meaningful
- Look for any visual elements that might continue or connect across pages
- Any element that contributes to visual narrative, flow, or aesthetic cohesion should be meaningful
- Even minimal design elements can be crucial for maintaining visual balance in spreads

Context: This image comes from page {{ page.page_number }} of a book. {% if page.page_number % 2 == 0 %}This is a left page (even-numbered), so it may be part of a spread with the next page.{% else %}This is a right page (odd-numbered), so it may be part of a spread with the previous page.{% endif %}

IMPORTANT: Be extremely generous in your assessment. When in doubt, classify as MEANINGFUL. The goal is to preserve the visual richness and design integrity of the book.

Provide me the answer in the given structure. Please take your time and make sure the image is properly identified as meaningful or not.

{#
This is the image of the entire page from the textbook for context.
{{ page.image_upath | image }}
#}
This is the image from the textbook with width: {{image.width}}px, height: {{image.height}}px:
{{ image.upath | image}}
Please determine whether this image is meaningful or not. Remember to be VERY PERMISSIVE - include all decorative elements, lines, figures, patterns, and visual design components. Only exclude if completely empty or corrupted. Provide your reasoning first, then your classification.
