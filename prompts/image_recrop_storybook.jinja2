The crop coordinates still don't look great. Here's the image chart again with a red box indicating the coordinates you gave me. Please fix this and give me better crop coordinates.

For storybook images, be especially careful about preserving content at the edges:
- Don't crop through the middle of figures, characters, or objects
- Preserve the edges of clouds, trees, buildings, and other background elements 
- If there's partial content at an edge (like part of a character's arm or a cloud), include the full element rather than cutting it off
- Only crop truly empty or blank space, not content that extends to the image boundaries
- When in doubt, include more content rather than risk cutting off important visual elements
